# Rolldark Game Master Agency

Rolldark Game Master Agency are a UK based company who provide paid Game Masters for Table Top Roleplaying Games both online and in person, as well as provide supplimentary products like Dice and Dungeons and Dragons modules for customers to run themselves.

The business currently uses a variety of third party solutions to run its website, which they have shown an interest in consolodating into one solution. They have mentioned several challenges they currently face, which they would like to resolve:

* Manual processing of invoices

Each Game Master working for Rolldark is self employed, and submits invoices monthly. Without unique reference numbers the Game Masters have to submit invoices with customer's email addresses as the identifying data, which has to be manually matched up by the accounts team for payment processing.

* Limited visibility of purchased tickets for online games

Game Masters currently have a shared spreadsheet that keeps them updated about who has purchased tickets to their games online, which has to be manually updated by the admin team. This is time consuming, and also means if a customer purchases tickets outside office hours the Game Master has no way of validating the payment has been received.

* Limited visibility of scheduled private games

Currently Game Masters organise their own calendars for private games, meaning they have to keep the admin team updated about any changes as they occur. This results in double handling of the data, as the admin team then have to update their own records to match which can lead to incorrect information if they are not updated with enough notice.
